Hi, I'm Raymond. I'm a Front End Engineer interested in design systems, developer productivity + tooling, accessibility, TypeScript, CSS, and UI/UX design. Currently based in San Francisco. ðŸŒ‰

Technologies I have experience with:

- JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS
- React, Redux
- Vite, Webpack, ESLint, Prettier
- Storybook, Figma

I currently work at [Mercury](https://mercury.com/) on the Front End Developer User Experience team. I've previously worked at [Gusto](https://gusto.com/), [Front](https://front.com), and [Gem](https://gem.com).
Check out [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raymondluong/) for more details on my work experience and my [uses page](/uses) for my current software and hardware setup.

Outside of software engineering, I like to [visit national parks](/parks), lift weights, play tennis, do/make crosswords, read sci-fi/mystery, travel to new cities, and produce electronic music.

Thanks for reading! Here's a picture of me petting an incredibly soft llama:
