Hi! My name is Raymond. I'm a mission-driven software engineer interested in
using technology to solve problems and improve the lives of others. I take a
human-centered and pragmatic approach to software development and I believe
in iteration and feedback over perfection. <strong>I most enjoy working on the front end,</strong> though I have worked across the stack and can put on other hats when necessary.
On top of coding, I have experience leading projects, organizing timelines, and
collaborating with cross-functional stakeholders (product, design, operations,
marketing, etc).

Technologies I have experience with:

- JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- React, Redux, TypeScript, Flow
- Vite, Webpack
- ESLint, Prettier
- Storybook, Figma
- Jest, React Testing Library, Enzyme

Currently I'm a Front End Engineer on the Platform team at <a href="https://gem.com/" target="_blank">Gem ðŸ’Ž</a>. I lead development of our internal design system and front end tooling. My background is in
Human-Computer Interaction from Stanford ðŸŒ². I currently reside in San Francisco, and
in my free time I enjoy practicing yoga, lifting heavy things, visiting national
parks, reading sci-fi, doing crosswords, traveling to new countries, and going to concerts.

Thanks for reading! Here's a picture of me petting an incredibly soft llama:
