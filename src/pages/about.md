Hi! I'm a Front End Engineer interested in design systems, developer productivity + tooling, accessibility, TypeScript, CSS, and UI/UX design. Currently based in San Francisco. ðŸŒ‰

I'm passionate about building beautiful and intuitive products that solve real problems. Additionally, I enjoy creating reusable and accessible design system components and implementing initiatives that improve developer productivity and experience. I value pragmatism, collaboration, and ownership, and I have experience leading projects, mentoring other engineers, and collaborating with cross-functional stakeholders.

Technologies I have experience with:

- JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS
- React, Redux, GraphQL
- Vite, Webpack
- ESLint, Prettier
- Storybook, Figma
- Jest, React Testing Library, Enzyme

Most recently, I worked at <a href="https://gem.com/" target="_blank">Gem ðŸ’Ž</a> as the first front-end focused hire. I led the development of their design system and owned initiatives related to front-end tooling and developer experience. On the design system side, I built components such as tables, menus, and form inputs. I also maintained documentation, coordinated migrations, established contribution guidelines, and ensured accessibility standards. On the tooling side, notable projects included migrating our build system from Webpack 4 to Vite, conducting a large-scale ESLint rule rollout, and writing codemods to migrate off deprecated patterns. In general, I was my own product manager and gathered both qualitative and quantitative data to prioritize projects and build our roadmap.

Thanks for reading! Here's a picture of me petting an incredibly soft llama:
