Hello! I'm a software engineer who enjoys front-end development and UI/UX design.

A few tools in my toolkit: JavaScript (ES6), React, Redux, Flow, Gatsby, Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS3, Git, VSCode, and Sketch.

Currently I'm a full-stack engineer on the <a href="https://gusto.com/product/benefits" target="_blank">Benefits team at Gusto</a>. Our mission is to build a world-class experience to help small businesses offer over 11 different types of benefits to their employees. Everyday weâ€™re dreaming of ways to level up our benefits offering by making it more affordable, accessible, guided, personalized, and seamless. We make our mission a reality by building recommendation systems for our customers, building automation for our operations teams, integrating with partners, supporting new regulations aimed at helping small business, and much much more.

Prior to Gusto, I studied Computer Science and Human-Computer Interaction at Stanford. Originally from New York, I first came to California for school and fell in love. I currently reside in San Francisco and in my free time, I enjoy yoga, reading, hiking, edm, and board games.
