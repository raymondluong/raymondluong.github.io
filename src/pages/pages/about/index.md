Hello! I'm a software engineer who enjoys front-end development and UI/UX design.

A few tools in my toolkit: JavaScript (ES6), React, Redux, Flow, Gatsby, Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS3, Git, VSCode, and Sketch.

Currently I'm a full-stack engineer on the <a href="https://gusto.com/product/benefits" target="_blank">Benefits team at Gusto</a>. Our mission is to build a world-class experience to help small businesses offer over 11 different types of benefits to their employees. We make our mission a reality by building guided and personalized recommendation systems for our customers, building seamless and efficient automation tools for our operations teams, and much more.

Prior to Gusto, I studied Computer Science and Human-Computer Interaction at Stanford. Originally from New York, I first came to California for school and fell in love. I currently reside in San Francisco and in my free time, I enjoy yoga, edm, reading, and board games.
