Hi! My name is Raymond. I'm a mission-driven software engineer interested in using technology to solve problems and improve the lives of others. <strong>I most enjoy working on the front end!</strong> (though I have worked across the stack and can put on other hats when necessary). I take a human-centered approach to software development and I believe in iteration and feedback over perfection.

Technologies I have experience with (or, a bunch of buzzwords):
- JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- React, Redux, TypeScript, Flow
- Jest, React Testing Library, Enzyme
- Ruby on Rails, RSpec
- Figma, Sketch

Currently I'm a full-stack engineer on the <a href="https://gusto.com/product/benefits" target="_blank">Benefits team at Gusto</a>. I work on delightful features to make healthcare more accessible to small businesses and their employees.

Prior to Gusto, I studied Computer Science and Human-Computer Interaction at Stanford. Originally from New York, I first came to California for school and decided that sun is better than snow so I stuck around after graduation. I currently reside in San Francisco and in my free time, I enjoy yoga, hiking, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/89704424-raymond-luong" target="_blank">reading</a>, edm, and travel. I'm always down to chat about JavaScript ( ðŸ¤“), the works of Haruki Murakami, dairy-free alternatives, and the best group fitness classes in SF (spoiler alert: it's Barry's Bootcamp).

Thanks for reading! Here's a picture of me petting an incredibly soft llama:
