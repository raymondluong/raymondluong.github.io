Hello! My name is Raymond. I'm a mission-driven software engineer interested in making an impact and improving the lives of others. I prefer working on the front end and take pride in creating delightful user experiences.

Technologies I enjoy working with: JavaScript, React, Redux, Ruby on Rails, Flow, TypeScript, Gatsby, HTML, CSS, Git, and Sketch.

Currently I'm a full-stack engineer on the <a href="https://gusto.com/product/benefits" target="_blank">Benefits team at Gusto</a>. Our mission is to build a world-class experience to help small businesses offer over 11 different types of benefits to their employees. Everyday weâ€™re dreaming of ways to level up our benefits offering by making it more affordable, accessible, guided, personalized, and seamless. We make our mission a reality by building recommendation systems for our customers, building automation for our operations teams, integrating with partners, supporting new regulations aimed at helping small businesses, and much much more.

Prior to Gusto, I studied Computer Science and Human-Computer Interaction at Stanford. Originally from New York, I first came to California for school and fell in love with the weather and culture. I currently reside in San Francisco and in my free time, I enjoy yoga, reading, hiking, edm, and board games.
