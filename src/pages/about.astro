  <p class="mb-5">
    Hi! My name is Raymond. I'm a mission-driven software engineer interested in
    using technology to solve problems and improve the lives of others. I take a
    human-centered and pragmatic approach to software development and I believe
    in iteration and feedback over perfection. <strong
      >I most enjoy working on the front end,</strong
    > though I have worked across the stack and can put on other hats when necessary.
    On top of coding, I have experience leading projects, organizing timelines, and
    collaborating with cross-functional stakeholders (product, design, operations,
    marketing, etc).

    Human-Computer Interaction from Stanford ðŸŒ². I currently reside in San Francisco, and
    in my free time I enjoy practicing yoga, lifting heavy things, visiting national
    parks, reading sci-fi, doing crosswords, traveling to new countries, and going to concerts.
