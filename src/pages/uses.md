My /uses entry, inspired by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/uses) and [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/). Last updated in February 2024.

### Development

- My main editor is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- I mostly use [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) for work and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) for personal projects.
- For my terminal, I use [Warp](https://warp.dev/) after starting on iTerm2. Warp has a sleek UI and a ton of quality of life features.
- I accelerate my development and automate repetitive tasks with [Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/).
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is my preferred build tool for new projects, though I am also comfortable with Webpack.
- I use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for component development.
- My code stays hygienic with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).
- I design in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).

### Hardware

- My current laptop is a MacBook Pro M3 Max with 128 GB RAM and 1 TB of storage.
- I have a dual monitor (1 vertical, 1 horizontal) + laptop stand setup. More screens = more productivity?
- AirPods Pro everywhere.
- I use a Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad.
- I navigate with a Logitech MX Master 3S mouse. The Magic Mouse is one of the worst products ever made. Don't @ me.

### Productivity

- I use [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) for notes, project management, and journaling.
- I track tasks with [Todoist](https://todoist.com/).
- I manage my windows with [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/).
- I store my passwords in [1Password](https://1password.com/). I gave up on LastPass after all the security breaches.

### This Website

- I use [Astro](https://astro.build/) for static site generation.
- I host this website on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### Desktop Apps

- I use [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) for listening to mostly electronic music.
- I produce music with [Ableton Live Suite](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/).
- I build crosswords with [Crossfire](https://beekeeperlabs.com/crossfire/).
