My name is Raymond. I’m a mission-driven software engineer interested in making an impact and using technology to improve the lives of others. <strong>I most enjoy working on the front end!</strong> (though I have worked across the stack and can put on other hats if necessary).</p>\n<p>Technologies I have experience with (or, a bunch of buzzwords): JavaScript, React, Redux, Ruby on Rails, TypeScript/Flow, Gatsby, HTML, CSS, Git, and Figma/Sketch.</p>\n<p>Currently I’m a full-stack engineer on the <a href=\"https://gusto.com/product/benefits\" target=\"_blank\">Benefits team at Gusto</a>. I work on delightful features to make healthcare more accessible to small businesses and their employees.</p>\n<p>Prior to Gusto, I studied Computer Science and Human-Computer Interaction at Stanford. Originally from New York, I first came to California for school and decided that sun is better than snow so I stuck around after graduation. I currently reside in San Francisco and in my free time, I enjoy yoga, hiking, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/89704424-raymond-luong\" target=\"_blank\">reading</a>, edm, and travel. I’m always down to chat about JavaScript ( 🤓), dairy-free alternatives, and the best group fitness classes in SF (spoiler alert: it’s Barry’s Bootcamp).</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading! Here’s a picture of me petting an incredibly soft llama:</p>\n<p><img src=\"./llama.jpg\" alt=\"Raymond petting a llama\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About me","date":null,"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/about/"}}
