I’m a software engineer who enjoys front-end development and UI/UX design.</p>\n<p>I first discovered programming when I was 10 years old. How? Virtual pets.\nI was <em>obsessed</em> with this website called Neopets that let you adopt virtual\npets and buy virtual items for them. Part of the fun included building your pet its own website.\nThrough a lot of trial and error, blindly copying and pasting code I googled (hey I was 10, I don’t still do this, for the most part), </p>\n<p>Currently, I’m on the Benefits team at Gusto. Our mission is to build a world class experience to help small businesses offer over 11 different types of benefits to their employees. Everyday we’re dreaming of ways to level up our benefits offering by making it more affordable, accessible, guided, personalized, and seamless. We make this a reality by building automation for our operation teams, building recommendation systems for our customers, deeply integrating with partners, supporting new regulations aimed at helping small business, and much much more.</p>\n<p>Prior to Gusto, I studied Computer Science and Human-Computer Interaction at Stanford.</p>\n<p>A few tools in my toolkit: JavaScript (ES6), React, Redux, Flow, Gatsby, Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS3, Git, VSCode, and Sketch. Currently working on TypeScript and Webpack.</p>\n<p>Preferred pronouns: he/him/his.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About me","date":null,"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/about"}}
