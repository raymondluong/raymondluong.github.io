							Professional Bio
						</div>
						<p>I am a software developer who's interested in front-end/full-stack engineering as well as UX design. I am currently a coterm student at Stanford, meaning I just finished my undergrad and I'm sticking around for an extra year to complete my Master's. </p>
						<p>In my coterm program, I am studying Computer Science, focusing on Human-Computer Interaction. My undergraduate major was in Management Science & Engineering, though it's safe to say I have since become a full-fledged techie. </p>
						<p>In between school years, I've interned at several places to try out new experiences. Most recently, I interned at Symantec as a Software Engineering Intern for the Norton eBusiness team, focusing on front-end and UI engineering. The previous summer, I interned at Zuora on the Business Operations team where I worked on sales and marketing operations.
						<p>I code, I sketch, I think, I learn, I solve problems. I am also currently looking for a job after graduation. If you are working on something and think I could help out, feel free to reach out!</p>
